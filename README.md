# ember-style-modifier

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jelhan/ember-style-modifier.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jelhan/ember-style-modifier)

This addon provides a `{{style}}` element modifier to set element's style.
This allows to set custom CSS of an element without requiring a [Content Security Policy](https://content-security-policy.com/) `style-src-attr: "unsafe-inline"`.

## Compatibility

It supports the same versions as [`ember-modifier-manager-polyfill`](https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-modifier-manager-polyfill#compatibility) does.

## Installation

```sh
ember install ember-style-modifier
```

## Usage

It expects CSS declarations as named arguments or as a hash as first positional
argument. Property names are supported in dasherized as well as in camelCase
spelling. Value must be a string or `undefined`. You may set a priority by
adding an `"!important"` suffix.

```hbs
<p
  {{style
    border="1px"
    padding="1em !important"
  }}
></p>

<p
  {{style
    (hash border="1px" padding="1em !important")
  }}
>
</p>
```

If option hash and named arguments contain CSS declarations for the same
property, named argument wins.

Adding styles to pseudo-elements is not supported.
